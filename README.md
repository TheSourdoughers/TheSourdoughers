## Description
We want to propose a solution for the food industry in underdeveloped countries, initially for the Cholula bakeries in Mexico. A solution that allows to increase the production of a healthy sourdough bread by automating the fermentation process.
We will leverage the power of technology to create a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and healthy way of living into human life by incorporating technology into artisan processes like bread production with sourdough.
