## Description
This project is part of the top 50 finalist in OAKDLiteContest. The BreadBot, is a prototype proposed to automate the process of fermentation of sourdough. We will be capable of monitoring the correct rising in the dough by measuring depth with the stereo cameras and at the same time monitor the apperance of the dough by running a YOLOv5 neural network thanks to the enourmous power and potential of the OAKDLite. 
With this application we want to  leverage the power of technology to create a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and healthy way of living by incorporating technology into artisan processes. 

## Software
- Depth quality control
- Appearance quality control
