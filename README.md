## Description
This project is part of the top 50 finalist in OAKDLiteContest. The BreadBot, is a prototype proposed to automate the 
process of fermentation of sourdough, a solution that allows increasing the production of healthy sourdough bread. With 
this application we want to  leverage the power of technology to create a sustainable, environmentally friendly, 
and healthy way of living by incorporating technology into artisan processes. 

We are capable of monitoring the appearance and height of the dough thanks to the enormous power and potential of 
the OAKDLite. Additionally, LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor kit is used to navigate between flour/water containers and to
mix the dough.
